              <p>Ectopia’s modular architectural system is made up of individual components
                that can be used to represent any formation. The components can be used
                individually or combined to form everything from houses, villages, atolls
                to entire states. Ectopia can be integrated into an existing government system
                 or setup as an autonomous governing state.</p>

              <h3>1.2. Atoll</h3>
              <p>The state will be made up of islands grouped as atolls. A state can contain any number of atolls and an atoll can be made up of any number of islands.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
              <h3>1.3. Village</h3>
              <p>Each village will support a total population of 152 residents. This number draws reference from Dunbar’s Number which suggests that the cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain a stable social relationship is 150. A village will support a maximum of 36 housing units.</p>

              <p>The structures will be built to be able to withstand any kind of natural disasters. 71% of the earth is the ocean. This gives us plenty of unused space to utilize for building more sustainable habitats. I see floating structures as the best option. Land reclamation means severe consequences for the environment.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
              <h3>2.2. Floating Structures</h3>
              <p>The floating structures will be made out of steel or concrete, anchored using mooring or using a more modern system. Springs or some other technology has to be used to keep the structures stable. Artificial reefs can be installed around and below the structure to help coral growth and support marine life to thrive.
